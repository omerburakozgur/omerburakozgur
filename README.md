## Projects

### Dungeon Janitors: Estate of Chaos

A C#-focused 4 player co-op prototype is being developed based on "Net-Ready" systems like "Host-Authoritative."
I prepared the technical design (TDD) and game design (GDD) documents for the project.
Skills Used: C#, System Design, Technical Documentation, Prototyping.

### Traces of Twins

I led a team of three to develop the Unity and code components of a 3D mobile mystery game prototype.
I programmed the event-driven inventory system and core game mechanics (stealth, clue gathering) using C#.
I implemented core optimization (Occlusion Culling) and Unity UI (Canvas) systems for mobile platforms.

### To The Reach

I completed the entire process myself, including design, programming (C#), pixel art (Aseprite), and animation.
I developed State Machine-based character controls and UI systems (menus, health bar) using Unity Animator.

### Simulator Prototype HDRP

A 3D simulation game prototype using Unity HDRP, global illumination, and photorealism, built using C# and Blender.
I designed, created, or edited and used the stage, terrain, sea, sky, fog, and cloud volume systems.
I learned and used the stage design tool, including terrain stamps, brushes, procedural terrain texturing tools, 3D and 2D foliage and trees, LOD levels, different lighting methods, and a day/night cycle.
